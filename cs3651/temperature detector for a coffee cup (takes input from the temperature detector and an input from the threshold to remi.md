timed lock box (an idea regarding against the procrastination for the students or even time managment. I want to develop a timed lock box where i am able to put my phone inside the box and set a timer, after the timer is over, the box unlock and i can take my phone out. for the input, i will have total of 4 buttons where setting the hours, minutes, and seconds and another enter button. (this can be capacitive sensing). inside the microcontroller, I will be able to count down the time. display on the lcd. output will be either lock and unlock.)
